/**
 * Integration Tests for Services
 * 
 * This directory contains integration tests that verify the complete functionality
 * of our service layer, including:
 * 
 * - Multi-step workflows and business logic
 * - Service-to-service interactions
 * - API client integration
 * - Error handling and recovery
 * - Data transformation and validation
 * - Caching and performance optimizations
 * - Tenant context management
 * - Batch operations and concurrent processing
 * 
 * These tests use mocked API responses but test the full service layer logic,
 * ensuring that complex workflows work correctly end-to-end.
